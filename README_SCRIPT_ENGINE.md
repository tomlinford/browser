# Script engine

JavaScript execution is performed by an _optional script engine_. I.e., you can
create a browser without one, and it'll just execute behaviour for `<script>`
blocks.

## Optional Sub-Modules

The script engines are provided as separate Go modules to avoid requiring
heavy dependencies (like V8) when they're not needed. This follows the same
pattern as the AWS SDK v2 for Go.

The main module (`github.com/gost-dom/browser`) has no JavaScript engine
dependencies. To use JavaScript execution, import the desired engine sub-module:

### Using V8 Engine

```go
import (
    "github.com/gost-dom/browser"
    "github.com/gost-dom/browser/scripting/v8engine"
)

func main() {
    b := browser.New(browser.WithScriptEngine(v8engine.DefaultEngine()))
    // ...
}
```

Or use the convenience package:

```go
import "github.com/gost-dom/browser/v8browser"

func main() {
    b := v8browser.New()
    // ...
}
```

### Using Sobek Engine (Pure Go)

```go
import (
    "github.com/gost-dom/browser"
    "github.com/gost-dom/browser/scripting/sobekengine"
)

func main() {
    b := browser.New(browser.WithScriptEngine(sobekengine.DefaultEngine()))
    // ...
}
```

### Without JavaScript

```go
import "github.com/gost-dom/browser"

func main() {
    b := browser.New()  // No script engine, `<script>` blocks are ignored
    // ...
}
```

## Available Engines

There are two script engines available:

- `github.com/gost-dom/browser/scripting/v8engine` - Uses V8
- `github.com/gost-dom/browser/scripting/sobekengine` - Pure Go JavaScript engine 

## Pros and cons

> [!NOTE]
> While the pros and cons measures factors affecting performance, both build and
> runtime, nothing has been measured yet.

### V8

- Pros
  - Based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, this is more or less guaranteed to
    be maintained, supporting new JavaScript features
  - Supports creating "templates", avoiding recreating global scope for every
    test or when the browser navigates/reloads
- Cons
  - Requires CGo (although only for test code, not production code for the
    intended use case)
  - JavaScript objects to not integrate to Go's garbage collector. As a Go
    object can keep a reference to a JS Object, and a JS object can keep a
    reference to a Go object, the v8 engine effectively leaks object _in the
    context of a script context_. It shouldn't be a problem for the intended use
    case where contexts are created repeatedly.
  - V8 is a massive project, causing longer build times

### Sobek

[Sobek], a fork of [Goja] is a pure Go JavaScript engine. While Goja doesn't
have ESM support, Sobek was forked for this purpose.

- Pros
  - As JS objects are implemented by Go objects, garbage collection works as it
    should.
  - Pure Go dependency makes for significantly less build-time headaches,
    including potential future updates, thay may require CGo build changes.
  - Build times should _potentially_ be much faster, but this hasn't been
    measured.
- Cons
  - No support for creating a "template" of global scope. Every new JS scope
    needs to be initialized with all global scope.
    - The runtime cust of this setup hasn't been measured.

## Appendix

### About v8go

V8 is the JavaScript engine in Chrome. It has a C++ API, and requires a lot of
CGo code to work. However, this library is only intended for _testing_, not
production. So your production system does not inherit a CGo dependency.

V8 is based on the v8go project, Originally created by [Github user
rogchap](https://github.com/rogchap/v8go), but left unmaintaind. Now
[Tommie's branch](https://github.com/tommie/v8go) is the best maintained, e.g.,
it automatically pulls latest V8 sources from the chromium repository

Unfortunately, many v8 necessary v8 features were not implemented. I have added
support for  these in [my own v8go fork], and working with Tommie to get them
merged into his.
